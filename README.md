# tefa-starter

_tefa_ stands for Text Engine For Adventure - games.

It is a simple clojure library created to demonstrate and experiment
on basic clojure programming concepts.

## Usage

Clone the project.

Make sure you have a jdk installed, a [leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
set up, and a working editor with clojure support.

If you are new to clojure you can check
[this blog post](https://kongeor.github.io/posts/2016-10-08-getting-started-with-clojure-and-lighttable/)
on how to set things up.

From the project root run `lein test-refresh`. You should have 0 zero tests running.

Uncomment (remove the `#_`) from the first test in `core_test.clj` and try to implement
the corresponding function. When you do, uncomment the second test.

Loop.
